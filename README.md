<b>EGameTools (short for Eric's Game Tools) is a mod menu developed in C++ which aims to add additional features such as FreeCam, Third Person, Weather and Time control, etc. which the game does not provide by default and also to help ease mod developers in the process of creating mods.</b><br>

﻿﻿When you launch the game, a console window will appear. When it does, <b>DON'T CLOSE IT!</b> Closing it will also close the game.<br><br>
To toggle the mod menu, in-game press <b>F5</b> on your keyboard. The same key will open and close the menu.<br>
You can use your mouse to navigate the menu.<br><br>
To change the number of a slider value manually, press <b>Ctrl + Left Mouse Button</b> on the slider.<br><br>
A config file <b>EGameTools.ini</b> is stored in the same folder as the mod file which stores the mod menu's options.<br>
The menu includes hotkeys for each option which can be changed through the mod menu by clicking on the hotkey button and then pressing a key on your keyboard.<br>
To change them through the config file, visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes">this link from Microsoft</a> which contains all virtual key codes. Simply write the name of the keycode you want to use for each hotkey and save the config file.<br><br>
Changes to the mod menu or to the config file are always automatically saved or refreshed respectively.<br>
You <b>DO NOT NEED</b> to restart the game for changes in the config to be applied!<br>
If you want to regenerate the config file, delete it and it will automatically be regenerated.<br>

<b>DO NOT</b> use the discussions tab for bug reports.<br>
If there is a bug you're encountering, open a bug report, otherwise please refrain from using the discussions tab unless you need help or want to request additional features!<br><br>
Currently, this mod has been designed with <b>singleplayer</b> in mind. That means certain features might glitch out or completely stop working in <b>multiplayer</b>.<br>
If that happens, please open a bug report!<br><br>
This mod is supposed to survive game updates, but sometimes it doesn't if there's a huge game update. If it's a big game update that broke the mod, I'm most likely already aware and already working on a fix. If not, please open a bug report!<br>
